Sunlight streams through tall windows, catching the glint of metal instruments and music stands scattered about. The camera frames a group of teenagers waist-up as they rehearse together, their faces animated with excitement and concentration. The atmosphere is energetic and filled with the imagined hum of amplifiers, the strum of guitar strings, and the clatter of drumsticks echoing off the walls. The scene feels alive with creativity and teenage camaraderie.",
