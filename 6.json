Tiny snowflakes cling to their eyelashes, and a frosty mist rises gently from their breath. The background is softly blurred, hinting at a sparkling white slope and a few distant snow-covered pine trees. The bright winter sunlight glints off the snow, making the scene feel crisp, chilly, and full of energy.",
