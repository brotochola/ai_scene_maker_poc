    "scene_description": "A busy outdoor cafe on a sunny afternoon, the golden sunlight reflecting off the cobblestone street. Tables with colorful umbrellas dot the wide sidewalk, while people walk by chatting, laughing, and sipping drinks. The scent of coffee and pastries fills the air, mixed with faint sounds of distant traffic and birdsong. Buildings with bright murals line the background, and a small fountain splashes gently in the plaza. The overall vibe is lively and cheerful, with a sense of movement and activity in every corner.",
