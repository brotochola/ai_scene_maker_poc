    "story": "Two members of a local rock band sit across from each other in a corner booth at a neon-lit diner. They’ve just finished a late-night gig, but instead of celebrating, tension fills the air. One of them feels betrayed because the other suggested replacing a bandmate, and the conversation has boiled over into an argument. Each friend has their own reason for being upset, but deep down, they both care about the band and fear losing the bond they’ve built through music. This is a critical moment in their friendship and in the future of their group.",
    "scene_description": "Inside a retro diner bathed in warm, flickering neon light. The background hum of a jukebox mixes with the clinking of dishes and faint chatter from distant tables. A glossy red booth takes center stage, its shiny surfaces reflecting the glow of neon signs in the window. The mood is heavy and tense, with one friend leaning forward in frustration while the other sits back, defensive. The camera frames them waist-up, capturing their facial expressions, gestures, and the emotional charge between them. The surrounding details—condiment bottles, napkin holder, and a half-empty milkshake—add realism and texture to the scene.",
    "items": [
        "A teenage boy with messy dark hair wearing a faded black band t-shirt, leaning forward aggressively with hands flat on the diner table, brows furrowed in frustration.",
        "A teenage girl with shoulder-length dyed blue hair, arms crossed over her chest, leaning back against the booth with narrowed eyes, wearing a denim jacket covered in band patches.",
        "A shiny red diner booth with cushioned seats, positioned against the wall, reflecting neon light from the window.",
        "A tall glass milkshake, half-finished, with a red-and-white striped straw bent slightly to the side, sitting on the table between them.",
        "A napkin dispenser in chrome metal, catching reflections of the neon sign through the window.",
        "Two condiment bottles—one ketchup, one mustard—side by side at the edge of the table, slightly crooked.",
        "The edge of a jukebox visible in the background, softly glowing with multicolored lights.",
        "A neon sign in the diner window, casting a red-blue glow onto the booth and table surface.",
        "A ceramic plate with leftover fries, pushed to one side as if abandoned in the heat of the discussion.",
        "A crumpled paper napkin on the table near the boy’s hand, suggesting nervous fidgeting."
