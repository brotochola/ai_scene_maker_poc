    "scene_description": "A bustling outdoor cafe stretches along a cobblestone street under a bright afternoon sun. The warm yellow and orange awnings ripple gently in the breeze. Aromas of freshly baked bread and roasted coffee mingle with the crisp scent of nearby flowers. Patrons sit at small round tables, chatting, laughing, and waving to friends. In the distance, a street musician plays a lively tune on a violin, and pigeons flutter between the tables. The buildings around are painted in pastel colors, with ivy climbing up their walls, and the street reflects a lively, cheerful vibe.",
